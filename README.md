# Weather App :earth_americas:

## What it is
This weather app looks up real time weather forecast in almost any town/city in the world.
One can search by entering a city name or postcode.

## What I learnt
This project had a huge learning curve as it was the first React project I did. There were so many concepts to learn including:
- react components
- states and conditional rendering
- props/passing props between components
- environment variables
- using SCSS in React
- deploying to Github pages
- and the list goes on...

## Things to improve on
- get geolocation of user to display weather forecast in their local area by default.
- allow user to save or 'favourite' a city. Local storage can be used to store this data.
- improve accessibility by adding more meaningful html tags instead of divs


## :rocket: Quick Start
1. Clone this repo on your machine
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies.
3. Get **API KEY**

    You need your own free API Key from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to access live weather data. Create an account and get your key.
3. Open repo on a code editor of your choice. 
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add in your API key:

    ```
    //.env file
    
    REACT_APP_<your key name>=<key number>
    ```
5. run `npm start` to start your developer server
